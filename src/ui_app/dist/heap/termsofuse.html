# Rplexus Terms of Use

If you’re under the age required to manage your own Rplexus Account, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use a Rplexus Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you.

If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the services, then these terms apply to you and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services.

We’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones.

If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and an opportunity to export your content from your Rplexus Account using Rplexus Takeout, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues.

Many of our services allow you to interact with others. We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means you must follow these basic rules of conduct:

* respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights
* don’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) — for example, by misleading, defrauding, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others
* don’t abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt the services

If you choose to share some data, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.

To use our services on behalf of an organization an authorized representative of that organization must agree to these terms

To provide you with our services, we sometimes send you service announcements and other information. 

Finally, some of our services give you access to content that belongs to other people or organizations — for example,  description of shared devices, or data of shared nodes. You may not use this content without that person or organization’s permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in other people or organizations’ content are theirs, and don’t necessarily reflect of Rplexus views.

Some of our services include software that’s offered under open source license terms that we make available to you. So please be sure to read those licenses.

By law, you have the right to a certain quality of service, and ways to fix problems if things go wrong. These terms don’t limit or take away any of those rights. For example, if you’re a consumer, then you continue to enjoy all legal rights granted to consumers under applicable law.

We don’t make any commitments about our services. And unless required by law, we don’t provide implied warranties, such as the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

Rplexus reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your account if any of these things happen:

* you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies
* we’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order
* we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or liability to a user, third party, or Rplexus — for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn’t belong to you

By law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.

We may update these terms and service-specific additional terms. 

You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Rplexus Account.
