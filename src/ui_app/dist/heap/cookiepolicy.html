# Rplexus Cookie Policy

A cookie is a small piece of text sent to your browser by a website you visit. It helps the website to remember information about your visit, like your preferred language and other settings. That can make your next visit easier and the site more useful to you. Cookies play an important role. Without them, using the web would be a much more frustrating experience.

We use cookies for many purposes. We use them, for example, to help you sign up for our services, to protect your data.

You can see a list of the types of cookies used by Rplexus. Our privacy policy explains how we protect your privacy in our use of cookies and other information.

Below we describe the purposes for which we use these technologies.

If you’re signed into Rplexus, these technologies help us show you the right information and personalize your experience in line with your settings. For example, cookies enable Rplexus to identify you and verify your account.

These cookies allow our websites to remember information that changes the way the site behaves or looks, such as your preferred language or the region you are in.

We use security cookies to authenticate users, prevent fraudulent use of login credentials, and protect user data from unauthorized parties.

For example, we use cookies called ‘SID’ and ‘HSID’ which contain digitally signed and encrypted records of a user’s Rplexus account ID and most recent sign-in time. The combination of these two cookies allows us to block many types of attack, such as attempts to steal the content of forms that you complete on web pages.

Websites often collect information about how users interact with a website. This may include the pages users visit most often and whether users get error messages from certain pages. We use these so-called ‘session state cookies’ to help us improve our services, in order to improve our users’ browsing experience. Blocking or deleting these cookies will not render the website unusable.

Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings, which may be adapted to reflect your consent to the use of cookies. Further, most browsers also enable you to review and erase cookies. To learn more about browser controls, please consult the documentation that your browser manufacturer provides.
